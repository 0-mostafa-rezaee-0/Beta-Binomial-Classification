<h1 align="center">Documentation Directory</h1>

# 1. Purpose

This directory contains educational materials for the Beta–Binomial classification project. Media files (videos/audios/pdfs) are placeholders for future content.

# 2. Contents

## 2.1 Core Document
- `Beta-Binomial-Classification.md` — main educational write-up (see sections and examples)

## 2.2 Media Placeholders (kept for now)
- `IRT-Technical-Notes.pdf` (placeholder)
- `IRT-Video-Presentation.mp4` (placeholder)
- `IRT-Audio-Conversation.m4a` (placeholder)

# 3. Figures

- Visuals live in `../figures/`. The mastery map will be saved as `figures/mastery_map_placeholder.png` by the plotting script.

# 4. Notes

- IRT-specific text and images were removed or replaced.
- Media will be updated later; links can be adjusted without changing code.
