# Beta–Binomial classification

## Abstract

- **Beta–Binomial classification** is a **Bayesian model for binary outcomes** where the probability of success varies across groups and follows a Beta distribution.

- It's mainly used when you have **count data with extra variability**.

- Next step:  a **mini 3-layer roadmap**:
  1. Phase 1 — use Beta–Binomial for classification (like your current setup)
  2. Phase 2 — integrate IRT or logistic regression for difficulty-aware modeling
  3. Phase 3 — wrap it with a contextual bandit to optimize learning resource delivery.

- Practical conclusion:
  - **Beta–Binomial classification** is an **excellent "first-stage mastery classifier"** — lightweight, Bayesian, interpretable, and easy to tune.
  - But for *modeling learning over time* or *content difficulty*, it should be **paired or extended** (e.g., with IRT, BKT, or bandit models).

## 1. The Big Picture

**Beta–Binomial classification** is a **Bayesian probabilistic model** used when you want to model **discrete outcomes (success/failure)** across **many groups or trials**, especially when:

* The number of successes out of trials follows a **Binomial distribution**, and
* The **success probability (p)** itself **varies across groups** and is modeled by a **Beta distribution**.

So it's a **hierarchical Bayesian model** — a bridge between the **Binomial** and **Beta** distributions.

---

## 2. Core Intuition

Think of it like this:

> Each group (say, each student, patient, product, or user) has its own unknown probability of success, $p_i$.
> But instead of assuming $p_i$ is fixed, you assume it's drawn from a Beta distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Then:
```math
\begin{align*}
p_i &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) \\
y_i | p_i &\sim \text{Binomial}(n_i, p_i)
\end{align*}
```

Marginalizing out $p_i$ gives:
```math
y_i \sim \text{Beta-Binomial}(n_i, \alpha, \beta)
```

This allows **extra variability** ("overdispersion") compared to a plain Binomial model.

---

## 3. Why It Matters

The **plain Binomial** assumes a fixed success probability ( p ).
But in many real cases, success rates vary among individuals, items, or contexts.

Example:

* Each marketing campaign has different click-through rates.
* Each student has different ability.
* Each drug trial site has different response probability.

**Beta–Binomial** acknowledges this **heterogeneity** — it's a **Binomial with uncertainty about p**.

---

## 4. Typical Use Cases

| Domain                          | Application                                                    | Notes                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **A/B testing**                 | Model click-throughs per user group when group behavior varies | Adds realism over naive Binomial    |
| **Healthcare / Bioinformatics** | Model success/failure per patient, gene, or trial site         | Captures site-level random effects  |
| **Education / Psychometrics**   | Item responses with uncertain skill or difficulty              | Close to Item Response Theory roots |
| **Reliability / Manufacturing** | Defect counts per batch with varying defect rates              | Models overdispersion in counts     |
| **Sports / E-sports**           | Player win rates with limited data                             | Used in Bayesian Elo-style models   |

In classification, it's often used as a **probabilistic classifier for binary outcomes** when data are **count-based** (e.g., number of successes out of attempts).

---

## 5. Parameter Interpretation

* $\alpha$, $\beta$: Shape parameters of Beta distribution.

  * Mean success probability: $\mu = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$
  * Variance: $\frac{\alpha \beta}{(\alpha + \beta)^2 (\alpha + \beta + 1)}$
* Overdispersion compared to Binomial grows as $\alpha + \beta$ decreases.

## 6. Comparison to Logistic Regression

| Feature              | Beta–Binomial                       | Logistic Regression         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Type                 | Generative Bayesian model           | Discriminative model        |
| Handles grouped data | ✅ Naturally                         | Needs mixed-effects version |
| Overdispersion       | ✅ Built-in                          | ❌ Assumes iid Bernoulli     |
| Interpretability     | Medium (parameters ↔ prior beliefs) | High (weights ↔ log-odds)   |
| Data need            | Counts of successes/failures        | Individual labeled samples  |

So if you're classifying based on **counts per entity**, not individual labels, Beta–Binomial is elegant and robust.

---

## 7. Strengths

✅ **Handles overdispersion** — realistic when variance > Binomial variance
✅ **Hierarchical structure** — models between-group variability
✅ **Probabilistic predictions** — uncertainty baked in
✅ **Conjugate** — nice analytical properties in Bayesian inference
✅ **Useful with small samples** — prior smooths sparse data

---

## 8. Weaknesses

❌ **Limited flexibility** for complex covariates (you can't plug in features easily — need extensions like Beta–Binomial regression)
❌ **Not scalable** for very large data (compared to logistic regression)
❌ **Assumes Beta prior is appropriate** — sometimes too restrictive
❌ **Harder interpretability** for non-statisticians
❌ **Only binary outcomes** — not for multi-class without extensions

---

## 9. Extensions

* **Beta–Binomial Regression:**
  $p_i = \text{logit}^{-1}(X_i \beta)$, then model overdispersion with Beta–Binomial error.
  → Implemented in packages like `statsmodels` (Python) or `brms` (R).

* **Dirichlet–Multinomial:** Multiclass extension of Beta–Binomial.

* **Hierarchical Bayesian GLMs:** The generalization using modern probabilistic programming (PyMC, Stan).

---

## 10. Tooling / Implementation

**Python:**

```python
import pymc as pm

with pm.Model() as model:
    alpha = pm.HalfNormal('alpha', sigma=2)
    beta = pm.HalfNormal('beta', sigma=2)
    p = pm.Beta('p', alpha, beta, shape=n_groups)
    y = pm.Binomial('y', n=n_i, p=p, observed=y_i)
    trace = pm.sample()
```

Or, in **scikit-learn style**, you might use **Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression** as a more flexible analogue.

Excellent question — and very relevant to your adaptive learning system context.
Let's analyze it **directly for education**: when to use the **Beta–Binomial model**, and when to prefer other approaches.

---

## 13. Why the Beta–Binomial model fits education

Education data often looks like this:

| Learner | Item      | Attempts | Correct | ... |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | --- |
| A       | Concept X | 5        | 3       | ... |
| B       | Concept X | 7        | 6       | ... |

Each student attempts several questions, with varying success probabilities.
We want to **classify mastery** ("Proficient," "Familiar," "Attempted," etc.) from these counts.

This is *exactly* the use case for a **Beta–Binomial**:

[
p_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta), \quad y_i \mid p_i \sim \text{Binomial}(n_i, p_i)
]

* It assumes a **latent ability (p)** per student or per concept.
* It gives **posterior probabilities of mastery** even with few attempts.
* It **smooths** estimates — a student with 2/2 correct is *not automatically perfect*, because prior uncertainty is integrated.

---

## 14. Educational interpretation of the figure you showed

In your screenshots:

* **x-axis:** total attempts
* **y-axis:** correct attempts
* **Cells:** classified into categories like "Attempted," "Familiar," "Proficient"
* **Controls below:**

  * *Alpha Prior / Beta Prior*: control the "strictness" of the prior belief
  * *Confidence Thresholds*: define how certain you must be to label a learner as proficient
  * *Familiar/Proficient thresholds*: decision rules (e.g., 30%, 50%)

So you're basically visualizing a **Beta–Binomial mastery map** — each (attempts, correct) pair mapped to a predicted mastery category given your chosen prior and thresholds.

## 15. Strengths for education

| Feature                                 | Benefit                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Handles small data**                  | Works with few attempts per learner—important in adaptive systems                                 |
| **Provides uncertainty**                | Can express "not enough evidence" instead of overcommitting                                       |
| **Continuous learning evidence**        | Naturally updates with each new attempt (posterior update)                                        |
| **Simple & interpretable**              | Alpha/Beta can be tuned to reflect pedagogical priors (e.g., "students usually need ~5 attempts") |
| **Smooth transition across categories** | No harsh jumps; probability-based transitions between "Attempted" → "Familiar" → "Proficient"     |
| **Computationally lightweight**         | Works in real time, even on the client side                                                       |

## 16. Limitations in educational contexts

| Limitation                                     | Implication                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assumes all items equally difficult**        | Not realistic — item difficulty varies                                  |
| **Assumes all learners start from same prior** | Ignores heterogeneous skill or background                               |
| **No temporal learning curve**                 | Doesn't model *change in skill over time* (like Knowledge Tracing does) |
| **Binary outcomes only**                       | No partial credit or graded feedback                                    |
| **No item features or learner embeddings**     | Can't leverage content or learner metadata                              |

## 17. Comparison with alternatives

| Model                                | Description                                | Strengths                               | Weaknesses                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Beta–Binomial**                    | Bayesian count-based success model         | Simple, interpretable, good for small n | Ignores item difficulty & time  |
| **IRT (Item Response Theory)**       | Models ability & difficulty jointly        | Psychometrically strong, interpretable  | Static; no time dynamics        |
| **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)** | Hidden Markov model for learning over time | Captures learning progression           | Requires longitudinal data      |
| **Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT)**     | Neural version of BKT                      | Learns complex temporal patterns        | Black-box, data-hungry          |
| **Contextual Bandits / RL**          | Adaptive content selection                 | Optimizes teaching strategy             | Requires feedback & exploration |

## 18. Recommendation

| Educational scenario                         | Recommended model                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Few data points per student or item          | **Beta–Binomial** (great start)                |
| Modeling learning as skill improvement       | **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)**           |
| Large-scale data with many learners & items  | **IRT** or **Deep Knowledge Tracing**          |
| Adaptive recommendation / resource selection | **Contextual Bandits** on top of mastery model |

---

## 19. Practical conclusion

- **Beta–Binomial classification** is an **excellent "first-stage mastery classifier"** — lightweight, Bayesian, interpretable, and easy to tune.

- But for *modeling learning over time* or *content difficulty*, it should be **paired or extended** (e.g., with IRT, BKT, or bandit models).

Next step:  a **mini 3-layer roadmap**:

1. Phase 1 — use Beta–Binomial for classification (like your current setup)
2. Phase 2 — integrate IRT or logistic regression for difficulty-aware modeling
3. Phase 3 — wrap it with a contextual bandit to optimize learning resource delivery
